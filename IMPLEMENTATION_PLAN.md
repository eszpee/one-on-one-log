# Implementation Plan for One-on-One Log

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for the One-on-One Log contact management system using Test-Driven Development (TDD) with an iterative approach focused on delivering a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) as quickly as possible. Each feature will follow the "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle:

1. **RED**: Write a failing test that defines the expected behavior
2. **GREEN**: Implement the minimal code needed to make the test pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up the code while ensuring tests continue to pass

## Implementation Steps
