We're working in the /Users/eszpee/projects/mcp/one-on-one-log/ folder. Everything applies to this folder. Do not go above it. 

Study thoroughly the CLAUDE.md and README.md files that describe what we have. Then check PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.md to see the functional specification of the application. Finally, we're working according to IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.

ONLY READ THESE .MD FILES FOR NOW, trust what's written in them, no need to check deeper and read code files, unless necessary.

Implementation plan is a list of checkboxes, they have three states:
[ ] task not done yet
[x] task done
[-] task postponed - consider it done for now.

Work step by step, only focusing on one checkbox at a time. Sub-checkboxes should be implemented separately too! Parent checkboxes should only be ticked once all sub-checkboxes are done, one by one. Stop after implementing a sub-checkbox, explain what you did and how I can verify the success or failure of the step. I will confirm if we've achieved the (sub)step within the phase or main step, and the checkbox can be ticked, before moving on to the next checkbox. You can stop DURING implementation of a substep too to get confirmation if you want to be sure. 

To be clear: you need to STOP after implementing EVERY substep. DO stop at the []RED phase, and NOT move on implementing the []GREEN step, to satisfy tests.  I need you to stop after every substep, for example, stop after writing the (first failing) tests so I can verify, then, once I tell you, move on to implement the code to satisfy the tests, etc. 

Ask clarifying quesitons if necessary!
